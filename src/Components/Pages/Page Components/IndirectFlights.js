        The Internet as a social medium for art has become increasingly popular
        as time passes. From its first iteration as Web 1.0 which began in 1989
        to the current wave of Web 3.0, art on the internet has been involved in
        its nature. An example of this evolution is Joe Hamilton’s website
        “Indirect Flights” published in 2015. “Indirect Flights” is a website
        that showcases a vast multitude of photographic imagery from different
        parts of our human worlds and has also been dubbed as a “moving museum”
        by viewers of this net art. Joe Hamilton, born in 1982 in Tasmania,
        according to his website “makes use of technology and found material to
        create intricate compositions” (Hamilton, n.d.). From this, it can be
        understood that Hamilton’s work “questions our established notions of
        the natural environment within a society that is becoming increasingly
        networked” (Hamilton, n.d.) and these links and intertwinement help us
        better understand the work we will live in. To increase this
        understanding the web art's conceptual, aesthetic, and technical aspects
        shall be reviewed and critiqued to analyse how well this web art
        succeeds in existing on the internet as well as understanding how the
        internet now functions as a medium that serves to host such works of
        art.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beginning with the internet as a medium it is important to refer back to
        the previous point of acting as a host for the work. It is important to
        understand that the internet is a medium and not the artwork itself.
        There are however schools of thought that counter this point such as the
        lines of code that upkeep the internet being art itself as they require
        preservation as without them the internet would be destroyed (Ricci,
        2020) such as how paintings required some form of preservation as
        without this they will be destroyed. To challenge this most art would
        not exist if its medium were to be destroyed, Leonardo Da Vinci's
        artworks would not exist had paper not existed, and Beethoven’s
        symphonies would also be a concept had the piano not been created. A key
        factor in these two artists’ works is their mediums (a piano and paper)
        and an important medium in net art is the internet itself. Why this
        piece of media is considered a medium is due to how a medium function
        operates. A medium can be understood as a tool that serves to effect and
        communicate particular information whereby that information has been
        created to exist as artistic communication and expression. The medium
        itself cannot be the content but rather the message of the content.
        Hamilton’s web art serves to communicate the connections of different
        human worlds (which will be explored later) however this communication
        would not exist without a place to communicate this which is the medium
        or in this context the internet. Due to the internet being primarily a
        social media, it has its affordances and limitations for the artwork it
        serves to host (these artworks will be henceforth referred to as Net
        Art). Firstly, the limitations, it is known that once something is
        uploaded on the internet it is now available to the general public with
        internet access for as long as the servers do not crash, and information
        gets compromised. This poses the two discussions with the internet as a
        medium as this public access allows us to be able to view the artwork at
        any given place and at any time however, the internet itself is a large
        world almost as large as the one we live in and as such there is a lot
        of net art that exists in it leading to some works being lost on the
        internet and hard to find as reiterated by Dylan Rainforth “you don't
        need to go to a gallery to see Joe Hamilton's stunning work Indirect
        Flights: it's hiding in your web browser”. This statement encompasses
        the benefit of net art being easily viewed by anyone unlike most art
        that is enclosed in the context of a specific setting such as a museum
        and live performances however it is hard to find this artwork due to it
        hiding inside the large blanket of the internet. Another issue faced by
        net art as a broad spectrum and its nature is its challenging of
        authorship and authenticity. Once net art is on the internet is one the
        internet all its information and dynamics can be easily mimicked and
        redistributed raising concerns about whether net art is solely protected
        by the original author. Copyrights and trademarks help counter this on
        the bigger scale but for smaller artists, their work is not protected,
        and can any time be stolen from them with little they can do. Modern net
        art that exists during the Web 3.0 era has the benefit of being
        retrievable if destroyed and compatible with modern software making it
        easily accessible on various online platforms. For interest’s sake, it
        is important to note Web 1.0 art was static and had no UI, Web 2.0 art
        had dynamic interfaces and allowed real-time sharing of content and now
        Web 3.0 art allows interactivity which brings about the technical
        aspects of this net art.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interactivity has been a key factor in the Web 3.0 movement as it allows
        the viewer a deeper connection to the artwork as they are able to
        “manipulate” it instead of being forced to be in the confines of simply
        sitting and observing. Above interactivity the website also offers a
        simplistic user interface that allows users to easily navigate through
        each image that is being displayed, buttons are also simplistic in their
        nature as seen through the information button being the convention “i”
        in a circle and a close button being a cross in a circle. This leverages
        familiarity as even though all art is different the use of familiar
        tools to view that art allows individuals to be able to easily enjoy the
        art in its fullest nature as they understand how to fully navigate it.
        This website is also quite large in its nature as various pictures are
        being displayed and Hamilton has successfully combined all these images
        through the following processes. Firstly, image editing allows the
        images to flow into one another making the effect of being on giant
        images and artwork instead of easily distinctive pieces of a greater
        narrative. On this website, the layering of images aids in enhancing the
        flow of the viewing experience in several ways. Firstly, it creates
        depth through various dimensions, drawing viewers into the art and
        encouraging them to traverse the various layers and textures presented
        to them. The arrangement of images creates visual continuity throughout
        the website, leading the viewer from one section to the next without any
        disruptive breaks. The layering contributes to the narrative progression
        of the artwork, showing movement as the viewer goes through distinct
        stages within the narrative being communicated in the site. This
        communication can lead to the discussion of the conceptual aspects of
        the site which revolves around the relationship between humans,
        technology, and nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conceptually, Hamilton’s website uses juxtapositions of various concepts
        (humans, technology and nature as mentioned before) through how
        technology has now changed how we view these worlds and also the
        relationship between all these worlds. It can be said that Hamilton
        leveraged the theme of interconnectedness. As mentioned previously
        mentioned the images are all connected through a collage and this
        collage helps the idea of interconnectedness. The juxtaposition lies in
        how technology although being used as a medium raises concern regarding
        its impact on our natural environment and how it has made us understand
        nature in the digital age. Technology has no doubt innovated and
        bettered human lives and how we interact with nature and each other but
        this has also come as a sacrifice. We are able to be more productive,
        conduct better automation and learn more but the digital age has made us
        more alienated from each other, leading to higher pollution and
        destruction of our environment (through how the maintenance of the
        internet itself requires heavy machinery that contributes to pollution).
        Having these three worlds in this current context helps us in
        understanding more about them and each other by simply looking at the
        aesthetics presented by Hamilton.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aesthetic concepts of this net art use beauty to draw in, engage and
        teach conceptual aspects. Layering allows for depth through complexity.
        As mentioned before the website is a collage but the editing of these
        images creates a sense of unity as most collages rely on unrelated
        pieces coming together to create one large idea, this one wholistically
        and through analysing the sum of its parts allows for an understanding
        of every level. Having bright and vibrant colours also allows the
        website to be pleasing and it gives it a mood (which can be deduced by
        the viewers depending on their understanding of the site) that makes you
        more connected to the site as it triggers an emotional response from
        you. This balance and harmony, alongside dynamic composition techniques,
        enhance the artwork with movement and energy, engaging the viewers and
        encouraging deeper engagement with the net art. As a result, “Indirect
        Flights” is a visually powerful and thought-provoking piece of net art,
        where aesthetic pieces combined with the conceptual depth of
        interconnected create an immersive viewing experience.

        In conducting a strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats (SWOT)
        analysis of Joe Hamilton's "Indirect Flights," key factors become known.
        Firstly, its strengths lie in its accessibility and global reach,
        through the internet's capacity for widespread communication as a social
        medium. The artwork's interactivity enhances viewer engagement, while
        its aesthetic appeal draws audiences in, building emotional connections.
        However, weaknesses include challenges in accessibility in the large
        digital landscape, as well as concerns regarding the preservation of
        digital art and issues concerning copyright and authenticity.
        Opportunities come from the internet's potential for more global
        engagement, technological innovation in net art, and its power to
        educate and raise awareness of societal issues. Threats such as
        technological limitations, cybersecurity risks, and cultural and
        regulatory challenges are a concern for this website. Personally level
        Indirect Flights resonates with me as a digital arts student through how
        it can be such a deep and thoughtful piece of work by merely being
        images stuck together. As an aspiring digital artist, this can help me
        better understand the power of the art I create can evoke a multitude of
        ideas due to how I decided to create my art. This idea all goes towards
        understanding everything I create has the power to serve a purpose
        greater than being an aesthetically pleasing viewing experience. Joe
        Hamilton's "Indirect Flights" highlights the power of net art,
        leveraging the internet as a platform for artistic expression,
        exploration, and communication. Through its aesthetic beauty and
        conceptual depth and also the technical composition of the net art, the
        artwork helps viewers on a journey of discovery and reflection.
